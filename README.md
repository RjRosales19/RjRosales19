- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, it's me Speedy Rosales
  
Hey! I am Ryan Rosales, a devoted Software engineer, that has passion to learn and analyze newly upcoming technologies. With fabricator bonder experience, I have managed to sharpen my interpersonal skills and precision with my work that will assure customer satisfaction.

My journey to programming started when I took a basic intro course to software programming back in college, in that course I was able to learn basic HTML and C++. This was the ignition that started my pursuit of interest in development due to the challenges it brought and how complex or simple a solution could be. With my experience as a fabricator, I decided to change careers to a path where I could encounter complex problems that can ensure customer satisfaction as well as embarking a positive perspective of the world.

My prowess in software development includes HTML, CSS, React/Redux, Python, Flask, Express and SQL.
When I'm not in my coding atmosphere, you will encounter me doing physical activities, such as working out, volleyball, hiking, snowboarding. If you didn't find me, I was probably watching anime or playing video games.
